# The purpose of this project is to provide users with simple bindings that allows to use ElasticSearch asynchronous Client with same syntax as in this project https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py 

## Notice:
  1. Once official elasticsearch-dsl project implement async functionality,the usage of this project would become meaningless
  2. Only search is available at the moment. Update/Delete and etc is not supported but could be easily added
