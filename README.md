# Provides users with simple bindings that allows use of ElasticSearch asynchronous client with same syntax as in elasticsearch-py-dsl 

## Notice:
  1. Once official elasticsearch-dsl project (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py) implement async functionality,the usage of this project would become meaningless
  2. Only search is available at the moment. Update/Delete and etc is not supported but could be easily added
